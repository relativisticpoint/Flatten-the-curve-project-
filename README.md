# Flaten-the-curve-project-
# About
With the COVID-19 epidemic still raging around the world, we have decidedto raise public awareness by carrying out the “Flatten The Curve” project. The main idea of our project is to simulate our world where the virus propagates as well as some protocols established in many countries in order to reduce the number of infected people in addition to the role of some parameters when it comes to stopping the virus.
The user can start the simulation by excecuting the class class `FlattenTheCurve.java`
# Dots
The dots represent humans, they mimic the behavior of a crowd of people moving randomly during the day.
## Types of Dots :

### Healthy 
Green Dots represent healthy people.
### Infected 
Red Dots represent infected people who carry the virus. They can infect other healthy people.
### Dead 
Black Dots represent dead People, they are left on the spot of their death and do not influence the other dots. They are left on the map to give a general idea of the number of deaths caused by the virus.
# Graphs :
While the simulation evolves, one can get an idea of the rate of death and infection by looking at the rigth corner of the simulation window, the graph in blue represents the numberf infected people as a function of time, the graph in black shows the number of dead people as a function of time.
# Features
one can activate one or many features to stop the spread of the virus.
### Handwash
This button allows the user to make some people wash their hands. The user can control who and how many wash their hands ,  by clicking on the moving dots with their mouse.
